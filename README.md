# Data Science Masters Program -  Capstone Project - Module 2
* Project Overview

This project is part of Module 2 of the Data Science Masters Program at Alma Better, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The objective is to analyze the dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and translate them into business insights that support decision-making.

* Objectives
      
      * Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
      
      * Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis.
      
      * Identify correlations, anomalies, and trends.
      
      * Provide actionable recommendations to achieve business goals.

# Tech Stack

* Language: Python 3.x
* Libraries:
    * pandas, numpy → Data preprocessing
    * matplotlib, seaborn,plotly → Visualizations
    * jupyter notebook → Development environment

# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Data Cleaning
    * Handled missing values and duplicates.
    * Standardized column names and data types.
    
* Univariate Analysis
  * Distribution of Genres, Regions, Content etc.

* Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
   * Release Year Trends Content Wise
   * Release Year Trends Quality Wise
   * Relationship Analysis between imdb votes and imdb ratings etc.
   * Heatmaps - Highlighted correlations between release year, popular artistes and available title distribution
   * Pair Plots - Showed clustering behavior among certain important numerical attributes eg. rutime,imdb_score etc.

# Business Recommendations

* Content acquisition & production (invest in proven genres and actors).
* Marketing strategy (amplify shows already gaining traction in votes/popularity).
* Portfolio diversification (balance safe high-rating genres with experimental formats).
* Audience retention (leverage modern era hits and age old timeless classics).
